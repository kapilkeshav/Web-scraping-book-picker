# Web-scraping-book-picker
I recently learned web scraping using scrapy. So, here is a project. what it does is scrapes a websites for book titles and store them in a mongodb database. Then using a driver I have called a random document from the Mongodb database and it prints the results, suggesting you which book to read.
