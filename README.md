# Web-scraping-book-picker
I recently learned web scraping using scrapy. So, here is a project. what it does is scrapes a websites for book titles and store them in a mongodb database. Then using a driver I have called a random document from the Mongodb database and it prints the results, suggesting you which book to read.


# Prerequisites:
MongoDB

# Running The Project:
1) Download the repo in your computer
2) Create a virtual enviornment and in it install the required packages using thr "requirements.txt" file.
3) Open the repo in the venv and type the command "scrapy crawl book_spider". Be sure you have already initialized the MongoDb and have matched the port and host name.
4) after scraping is complete, run the "brp.py". It will tell you a book recommendation.
